Automatic CAPTCHA Recognition using CNN
About the Project
This project is an AI-based CAPTCHA solver that automatically recognizes text-based CAPTCHAs using deep learning. It leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to process CAPTCHA images and predict the characters with high accuracy.

 How It Works
Dataset 
The model is trained on the CAPTCHA Version 2 dataset from Kaggle.
Each CAPTCHA contains a combination of lowercase letters (a-z) and digits (0-9).

Preprocessing 
Convert images to grayscale for better feature extraction.

Resize images to a uniform 200x50 pixels.

Normalize pixel values to [0,1] for efficient training.

Convert text labels to one-hot encoded vectors.

Model Architecture 
Convolutional Layers (Conv2D) for feature extraction.
MaxPooling Layers to reduce spatial dimensions.
Batch Normalization to improve convergence.
Fully Connected Layers (Dense layers) for classification.
Dropout Layers to prevent overfitting.
Multiple output layers (one for each character in the CAPTCHA).

Training & Optimization 
Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy
Optimizer: Adam
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Validation Loss

Early Stopping to avoid overfitting.

Evaluation & Results 
Accuracy and loss are tracked for both training and validation sets.

The final model achieves high accuracy in recognizing CAPTCHA characters.
